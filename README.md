spring-ioc-learning
===================
The content in package com.spring.springidol is the exercise from book Spring In Action, which is used for learning how to use spring setter injection and constructor injection with xml.

The content in package com.spring.myspring.ioc is my implementation of setter injection.

The content in package com.spring.annotation.springidol is the same exercise as what is from Spring In Action but using annotation instead of xml.
